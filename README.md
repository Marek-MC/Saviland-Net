# What is Saviland Net? 

This is... My base.
I have to develop a clear identity for it.

What am I gonna use it for? 
What is it gonna look like?

- Cloud storing important files and data.

- Communicate with friends and visitors. 
- ^ Login, logout, register for an account, and edit/delete account in your profile screen.

# There will be Two Parts

~ Savis Base ~
Access Level: Me - 
Used for safekeeping my own files, DM people registered on my platform, and scan through an information hub connected to the Saviland_Net_DB itself. This information hub will contain lists ranging from: servers, profiles, just about everything. (Note: My base is completely seperate from Chatspace!)

~ Chat Base ~ 
Access Level: Public -
Send messages in joined servers, DM users, and explore information that your permission level grants you. There will be server profiles, and have server roles, just like Discord! In fact, it will be a lot like Discord!
